    Identify key state staff who will be involved in all activities listed in
    this APD. CMS seeks to ensure state teams are adequately resourced, but
    does not require states to provide key vendor personnel to satisfy this
    requirement.


    Personnel listed in this section must be assigned to APD by name, role,
    time commitment, and cost, where applicable.
  reminder: >-
    Key personnel are individuals involved with all activities within this
    APD, or are invloved with governance, coordination, stakeholder
    decision-making, oversight, and/or project performance. Individuals with
    specific responsibilities for an activity basis only, should be listed
    individually in Program Activities section of the eAPD.
